A Beginner’s Guide to GitHub and How to Use It
GitHub is one of the most popular platforms for version control and collaborative development. Whether you’re a developer, designer, or tech enthusiast, understanding GitHub can enhance your productivity and help you contribute to various projects effectively. This guide will walk you through the basics of GitHub and how to use it.

What is GitHub?
GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git, a version control system created by Linus Torvalds. It allows teams and individuals to:
	• Collaborate on projects: Multiple people can work on the same codebase without overwriting each other’s work.
	• Track changes: Every modification is recorded, making it easy to revert changes or see who contributed what.
	• Host repositories: Store your code in a central location, either publicly or privately.
	• Integrate tools: Use CI/CD pipelines, project management boards, and other tools to enhance your workflow.

Setting Up GitHub
	1. Create an Account:
		○ Visit GitHub and sign up for an account.
	2. Install Git:
		○ Download Git from git-scm.com and install it on your computer.
	3. Configure Git: Open a terminal and set up your Git username and email:
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"

Basic GitHub Workflow
1. Create a Repository
A repository (repo) is where your project lives.
	• Go to your GitHub dashboard and click the "+" icon > "New repository."
	• Name your repository, add a description, and choose public or private.
	• Optionally, initialize it with a README file.
2. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine to start working on it.
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
3. Make Changes Locally
Navigate to the repository folder and make changes to your files.
cd repository-name
4. Stage and Commit Changes
After editing, stage the changes and commit them.
git add .      # Stage all changes
git commit -m "Your commit message"
5. Push Changes to GitHub
Send your committed changes to the GitHub repository.
git push origin main
6. Pull Changes from GitHub
If someone else has made changes, pull the latest updates.
git pull origin main

Collaborating on GitHub
Forking and Pull Requests
	1. Fork a Repository:
		○ Forking creates a copy of someone else’s repository under your account. Click the "Fork" button on the repository’s page.
	2. Clone Your Fork:
		○ Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
	3. Make Changes and Push:
		○ Make your changes locally and push them to your forked repository.
	4. Create a Pull Request:
		○ Go to the original repository and click "Pull Request" to propose your changes.
